| **Purpose**                | Provides a layered approach for organizing code to enhance maintainability, scalability, and testability. | Separates UI logic from business logic to improve the organization of UI-related code. |
| **Components**             | Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, Frameworks & Drivers | Model, View, ViewModel                     |
| **Layers**                 | Multi-layered structure, with each layer having a specific role (e.g., core, application, infrastructure). | Primarily focuses on three components: Model, View, and ViewModel. |
| **Dependency Management**  | Implements the Dependency Rule, where inner layers donâ€™t depend on outer layers. | ViewModel can depend on Model, and View can observe changes in ViewModel. |
| **Flexibility**            | Highly flexible; allows changes in any outer layer without affecting core logic. | Mostly flexible for UI changes but less so for core business logic. |
| **Testability**            | High testability for all layers, facilitating unit testing across the application. | Easier testing of the ViewModel, as it decouples UI logic from the View. |
| **Usage Context**          | Applicable for a wide range of applications, including web, mobile, and enterprise systems. | Commonly used in UI-centric applications, particularly in mobile and desktop frameworks. |
| **Data Binding**           | No built-in data binding; data flow is handled explicitly through method calls. | Supports data binding, allowing automatic updates of the View based on changes in the ViewModel. |
| **Complexity**             | Can be more complex to implement due to multiple layers and strict rules. | Generally less complex, focusing mainly on UI interactions. |
